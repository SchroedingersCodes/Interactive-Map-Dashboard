        <p> Niger State, located in North-Central Nigeria, is the largest state in the country by landmass, covering
            approximately 76,000 square kilometers. The state has an estimated population of over **5.7 million people**
            and is predominantly rural, with agriculture being the major occupation. Crops like rice, millet, maize, and
            yams thrive here, alongside cattle rearing, contributing to the state's economy. The state also possesses
            rich mineral resources, including gold, marble, and limestone.</p>

               This is the first point of contact when someone needs medical care. It includes
                basic services like check-ups, vaccinations, and treatment for common illnesses (like colds or minor
                injuries). It's usually provided at local clinics or health centers.

                        treatment, patients are referred to secondary healthcare. This is provided by hospitals or
                        specialists, for things like surgeries, specialist consultations, or advanced diagnostic tests.

                   This is the most advanced level of healthcare. It involves highly specialized treatments
                    or surgeries that require expert care, often provided in teaching hospitals or large medical
                    centers. Examples include cancer treatment, organ transplants, or complex surgeries.

        <p>Health centers in Niger state are predominantly categorized into primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare
            centers. However, despite its agricultural and natural wealth, Niger State faces significant challenges in
            healthcare delivery. The state has a high number of primary health centers (PHCs), especially in rural
            areas, but there is a severe shortage of secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities. This imbalance places
            immense pressure on primary centers, which are often ill-equipped to handle complex cases. People in need of
            specialized care frequently have to travel to neighboring states, contributing to healthcare inefficiencies
            and delays in treatment.</p>
        </p>

        <p>Healthcare Situation in Niger State:

           
            Niger State has a network of 1967 primary healthcare centers, but the number of secondary facilities is only
            around 32, and there are only 11 tertiary hospitals. This unequal distribution poses a major challenge for
            the healthcare system, especially for those in rural areas who rely on Primary Healthcare Centers for all forms of care, including
            emergencies.
            <br>
            <br>

            Challenges:
            <ul>
                <li>Understaffing and Equipment Shortages: Many Primary Healthcare Centers lack qualified doctors and
                    nurses, and the
                    available
                    medical equipment is often outdated or insufficient. </li>
                <li>Rural Healthcare Access: People in remote parts of Niger State face long distances to access
                    secondary
                    or tertiary care, which often results in avoidable health complications.
                </li>
                <li>Inadequate Referral Systems: The state has a poor referral system between Primary Healthcare Centers
                    and higher-level
                    facilities, leading to delays in receiving specialized treatment.
                </li>

            </ul>
